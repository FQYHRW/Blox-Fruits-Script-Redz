## 🚀 Key Features of an Advanced Blox Fruits Script

Here’s a breakdown of the most sought-after features built into top-tier Blox Fruits scripts:

---

### 🔄 Auto Farm – Effortless Combat and XP Gains

No more manually battling mobs to earn experience or money. The Auto Farm feature lets your character auto-attack enemies, finish quests, and rack up rewards while you relax or multitask.

**Highlights:**
- Target enemies based on level range
- Loop quests for consistent progression
- Smart positioning to avoid knockbacks
- Passive leveling during downtime

Perfect for fast leveling without repetitive effort.

---

### 🗺️ Instant Teleportation – Save Time, Travel Anywhere

Sailing between islands or zones? That takes time. Teleportation tools allow you to instantly move to:

- Quest NPCs
- Specific bosses
- Training zones
- Spawn locations

This speeds up farming, questing, and rare item collection by letting you go wherever you need—immediately.

---

### 🥭 Devil Fruit ESP – Real-Time Fruit Detection

One of the best ways to power up in Blox Fruits is by using powerful Devil Fruits. But finding them manually is difficult and competitive.

ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) lets you:
- Track all active fruits on the map
- See names and locations in real-time
- Get alerts on high-value fruit spawns

Whether you’re chasing Dragon, Dough, or Light, you’ll never miss a drop again.

---

### 🎯 Auto Quest – Seamless Missions on Autopilot

Leveling often involves constant quest-taking. The Auto Quest system removes that burden by:

- Automatically accepting quests in your level range
- Completing missions with auto combat
- Turning in rewards and looping again

This feature works hand-in-hand with Auto Farm for a fully hands-free experience.

---

### 📊 Auto Stat Allocation – Build Smarter

Stat points can shape your character’s power, but assigning them manually every time is a drag. Auto stat allocation takes care of that by distributing points based on your combat style.

You can set it to focus on:
- Melee
- Fruit powers
- Defense
- Sword techniques

It’s a great way to maintain consistency across all levels.

---

### 🌀 Mastery Auto Farm – Unlock Skills Faster

Mastery is what unlocks advanced abilities for fruits, weapons, and fighting styles. Instead of grinding it out, the script can focus specifically on leveling mastery.

**Features:**
- Chooses low-risk enemies for fast kills
- Supports multiple types (fruit, sword, etc.)
- Unlocks combat abilities quicker

Ideal for players who want to maximize their power potential quickly.
